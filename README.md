# PopQuiz_java

## Description

The intention of this website was to create a fun quiz individuals can take to learn some new things and so I can practice my JavaScript knowledge, however, I changed strategies completely after 15 hours of work of attempting for and if statements. If you'd like to see my original path, please see script2.js.

The result was my best attempt to fulfill all requirements, however after going down a number of different rabbit hole strategies, this is what I have working. 

To create this quiz, I attempted to utilize the following skills:

- Event listeners;
- Hearty psuedo-coding;
- Functions;
- How to change an element's class using Javascript;
- The power of learning from Google and Youtube;
- Using the Console to check work as you create;
- and so much more!
