# PopQuiz_java

## Description

The intention of this website was to create a fun quiz individuals can take to learn some new things and so I can practice my JavaScript knowledge. Hope you learn a thing or two about our friendly neighbors - the bees.

To create this quiz, I attempted to utilize the following skills:

- Event listeners;
- Hearty psuedo-coding;
- Functions;
- How to change an element's class using Javascript;
- The power of learning from Google and Youtube;
- Using the Console to check work as you create;
- and so much more!
