# PopQuiz_java

## Description

This website was created from scratch to create a fun quiz individuals can take to showcase my new JavaScript knowledge. To create this quiz, I utilized the following skills:

- Event listeners;
- Hearty psuedo-coding;
- Functions;
- How to change an element's class using Javascript;
- The power of learning from Google and Youtube;
- Using the Console to check work as you create;
- and so much more!
